# Warm spaces

With a cost-of-living crisis and an energy-price crisis, lots of people will be cold this winter and looking for warm places to go. Several different groups have started collating directories of warm spaces. This duplicates work and means each single resource is less complete. Also, the data isn't published openly but instead mostly displayed via map interfaces which tend to create quite large page loads - not great for anyone using limited mobile data plans.

## Existing directories of warm spaces

To add more directories, update the [data/data.yml](data/data.yml) file then run `perl build.pl` in the `data/` sub-directory.
