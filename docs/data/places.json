But as people age, they often find themselves spending more time alone. Being alone may leave older adults more vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation, which can affect their health and well-being. Studies show that loneliness and social isolation are associated with higher risks for health problems such as heart disease, depression, and cognitive decline. If you are in poor health, you may be more likely to be socially isolated or lonely. If you are socially isolated or feeling lonely, it can put your physical and mental health at risk. Adults who are lonely or socially isolated are less healthy, have longer hospital stays, are readmitted to the hospital more often, and are more likely to die earlier than those with meaningful and supportive social connections.","hours": { "_text":"Monday: 10:00 - 15:00, Tuesday: 10:00 - 15:00, Wednesday: 10:00 - 15:00, Thursday: 10:00 - 15:00, Friday: 10:00 - 15:00, Saturday: 11:00 - 14:00","opening":"Mo 10:00-15:00; Tu 10:00-15:00; We 10:00-15:00; Th 10:00-15:00; Fr 10:00-15:00; Sa 11:00-14:00" },"lat": 50.79536,"lon": -1.12109, "title":"C2U Gosport" },

We often have themed days, e.g., Pancake Day, where we served fresh pancakes, and also had fun events (including pancake races for children). We also have craft activities (e.g., mosaic making sets), that visitors can come and sit and do, as we have found these mindful activities help people relax, and provide a focus for people who are struggling with anxiety and mental issues. Tables are also set up in the small side room (off the main hall) to provide a ‘quiet space’ for those who find social settings difficult, and this also serves as a ‘shared working from home’ space. Free Wi-Fi is provided. We have incorporated a Parent & Toddler group into the Community Hub, which has been well used and goes from strength to strength. During the holidays we have encouraged the attendance of older siblings and provided craft activities for them to do. We are keen to promote sustainability in the community whenever we can – the GRowsley community group and local allotment holders donate excess produce.

Poverty and power abuse must be rooted out, if we are genuinely interested in supporting and empowering communities to participate and indeed enjoy civic life equally. To this end, all local service providers (public, private and voluntary) must come together and under the guidance of the restorative justice values of power sharing, equality, dignity and respect support local communities.

Building Communities provides particular support to BAME and marginalised women, 50yr+, lone parents, vulnerable, asylum seekers, refugees and NEETS who have no skills, no confidence, residential status issues and thus do not meet eligibility criteria to enrol onto government funded programmes, due to these reasons and barriers. Through unaccredited programmes, we provide essential key basic skills to engage them into society and pave pathways for continued learning and workshops to gain life skills.","hours": { "_text":"Monday to Friday, 9:30am to 3:00pm This warm welcome is open for people aged 19 years old and over.","opening":"Mo-Fr 09:30-15:00" },"lat": 52.45526,"lon": -1.87739, "title":"Building Communities","url":"https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/directory_record/439771/building_communities" },

Instead of buying a new item that ends up never being used again, members can pay a small fee to borrow it, use it and return it when they’re done with it! The scheme, which is based at our Bridgend shop on Caroline Street, allows for low-cost borrowing which helps our members from all walks of life, allows people to use stuff that they don’t have space to store around their home, and promotes the idea of an environmentally-friendly circular economy where the same items get used multiple times instead of just once. All our items are priced at a recommended borrowing amount which we believe to be fair and accessible to most households. If you are feeling the squeeze on your living costs, do not hesitate to come in and we can sort out an adjusted price for you. We will work with you to make sure the price is as fair as possible. Photo I.D. and proof of address will be required for the first time you borrow.
