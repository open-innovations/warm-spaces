Instead of buying a new item that ends up never being used again, members can pay a small fee to borrow it, use it and return it when they’re done with it! The scheme, which is based at our Bridgend shop on Caroline Street, allows for low-cost borrowing which helps our members from all walks of life, allows people to use stuff that they don’t have space to store around their home, and promotes the idea of an environmentally-friendly circular economy where the same items get used multiple times instead of just once. All our items are priced at a recommended borrowing amount which we believe to be fair and accessible to most households. If you are feeling the squeeze on your living costs, do not hesitate to come in and we can sort out an adjusted price for you. We will work with you to make sure the price is as fair as possible. Photo I.D. and proof of address will be required for the first time you borrow.
