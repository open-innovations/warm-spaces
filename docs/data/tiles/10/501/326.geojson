It's a vibrant community space where warmth and laughter are brewed alongside our unique CBD-infused beverages. Our Coffeeshop, renowned for its cozy, welcoming atmosphere, is a popular gathering spot for locals and visitors alike. We're proud to be more than just a coffee shop. As an active participant in community welfare, we run several projects reflecting our commitment to social responsibility: **Women's Period Poverty Collection Point:** - We believe in supporting those in need. Our collection point for menstrual products helps address period poverty in our community, ensuring everyone has access to essential hygiene products. **Suspended Coffee Scheme:** Inspired by the tradition of \"caffe sospeso,\" we embrace the spirit of paying it forward. Customers can purchase an extra coffee, which we 'suspend' for someone in need â€“ a simple gesture that warms hearts and uplifts spirits. **ADHD Cumbria Hub:** Understanding the unique challenges faced by individuals with ADHD, our coffee shop doubles as a hub for ADHD Cumbria. Here, we provide a supportive space for sharing experiences, accessing resources, and building a supportive community. At West Lakes Hemp Company, we're more than a business; we're a part of the community fabric, dedicated to making a positive impact. Join us for a coffee and be part of our mission to make the world a little brighter & a little greener, one leaf at a time.","hours":{"_text":"Monday: 10:00 - 17:00, Tuesday: 10:00 - 17:00, Wednesday: 10:00 - 17:00, Thursday: 10:00 - 17:00, Friday: 10:00 - 16:20, Saturday: 10:00 - 14:00","opening":"Mo 10:00-17:00; Tu 10:00-17:00; We 10:00-17:00; Th 10:00-17:00; Fr 10:00-16:20; Sa 10:00-14:00"},"title":"West Lakes Hemp Coffeeshop"},"type":"Feature"},
