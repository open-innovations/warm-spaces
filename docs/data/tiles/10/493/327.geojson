Our space is rooted in faith and built on a simple conviction: to love God and love people by creating a place where everyone is valued, welcomed, and supported. A donation-based café open Monday to Friday, 9.30 am-5.30 pm, where people can enjoy food and friendship whether or not they can pay. Toddler & baby clubs, giving parents and carers a safe and joyful space to connect while their children play. English classes for newcomers, building confidence and helping people integrate into the local community. Community activities such as free lunches, after-school drop-ins, creative workshops, and a pre-loved store that meet practical needs while building connection. Pastoral care & counselling, offering emotional and spiritual support through listening, prayer, and professional care. In November 2024, Vibe Community Hub was honoured at the IPB Pride of Place Awards, where we won the Inclusive Communities (City) category, with Co-operation Ireland as the key partner. The judges highlighted our success in welcoming people from diverse backgrounds, providing safe spaces for families and young people, and regenerating our area with sincere care and inclusion. This recognition affirmed that our Hub is not just a facility but a life-giving presence in the city. At Vibe, we believe every person is made in God’s image and deserves dignity, compassion, and hope. Through hospitality, shared meals, community, and prayer, we have seen lives touched, friendships formed, and isolation replaced with belonging. Our Warm Welcome Space is a living expression of faith in action—meeting needs, lifting spirits, and building a stronger, more connected community.","hours":{"_text":"Monday: 09:30 - 04:30, Tuesday: 09:30 - 04:30, Wednesday: 12:30 - 04:30, Thursday: 09:30 - 04:30, Friday: 09:30 - 04:30","opening":"Mo 09:30-04:30; Tu 09:30-04:30; We 12:30-04:30; Th 09:30-04:30; Fr 09:30-04:30"},"title":"Vibe Community Hub"},"type":"Feature"}
