We support people aged 60 and over across North East Essex and Braintree with a wide range of free, confidential and person-centred services. Whether it’s advice on welfare benefits, support with care and housing options, or help applying for Blue Badge parking permits, our experienced advisers are here to make navigating life’s challenges easier. We provide advice by phone, email, and in person through home visits, ensuring everyone can access the help they need in a way that suits them best. Our services also include specialist dementia support in North East Essex, where our dedicated advisers guide individuals and their families through every step of their journey - from diagnosis to planning ahead. For unpaid carers, our NE Essex Carer Navigation service offers practical advice, emotional support, and help accessing services such as respite, peer support groups, and educational opportunities. We also offer a Befriending service for adults aged 18 and over, helping to reduce loneliness and isolation across all of Essex, including Thurrock, but excluding Southend. Our trained volunteers provide regular home visits or weekly telephone calls to those who are housebound or feeling isolated. For those who want to reconnect with their community but need a bit of support to do so, our Community Companions offer encouragement and assistance to attend local activities. We also bring people together through small, volunteer-hosted meetups, giving clients the opportunity to build friendships and connect with others in similar situations. At Age Well East, we’re here to empower people, improve wellbeing, and help communities thrive - every step of the way.","hours":{"_text":"Mo 09:00-16:00; Tu 09:00-16:00; We 09:00-16:00; Th 09:00-16:00; Fr 09:00-16:00","opening":"Mo 09:00-16:00; Tu 09:00-16:00; We 09:00-16:00; Th 09:00-16:00; Fr 09:00-16:00"},"title":"Age Well East","url":"https://www.essexmap.co.uk/places/age-concern-colchester-north-east-essex/"},"type":"Feature"}
