The Hub was started in response to the cost of living crisis with people experiencing the effects of increasing energy and household bills. In addition, some people, particularly the elderly, were experiencing social isolation and loneliness following the Covid pandemic. Over the winter months the Hub has offered a warm place for people to meet providing refreshments and homemade soup with a roll at lunchtime, all free of charge. We have continued to provide a space to meet and sandwich/refreshments throughout the summer months too. In addition we provide a free gentle exercise class twice a month between 2.00 and 3.00 p.m. which is funded by Active Essex (dates advertised on the website).","hours":{"_text":"Thursday: 10:00 - 13:30","opening":"Th 10:00-13:30"},"title":"Emmanuel Church"},"type":"Feature"},
