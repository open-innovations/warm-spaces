We will provide activities like Bowling, Boccia, board games and ping pong. Our Warm Spot will be open to everyone, however we want to add a focus onto young families by creating a free soft play area- we believe this is a gap in the warm spots market as most are advertised for older generations. Our Better health team will attend for anyone who wants a basic health check (BMI/ Blood pressure). This will help people feel empowered around their own health- we will be able to answer questions on exercise and healthy living.","hours":{"_text":"Monday: 14:00 - 16:00","opening":"Mo 14:00-16:00"},"title":"Cleator Moor Activity Centre"},"type":"Feature"}
