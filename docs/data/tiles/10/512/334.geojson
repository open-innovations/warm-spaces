The building was refurbished in 2017 including: eco-friendly air source heating system; new ceiling with LED lighting, vinyl flooring and fire-resistant doors; a disabled toilet together with baby changing facility; upvc double-glazed windows and new tables and chairs. In 2019, the car park was refurbished and in 2022 the kitchen upgraded and the main and fire doors updated. The venue is a clean and warm up-to-date facility that is at the heart of the village. We will be providing hot and cold refreshments including, most people's favourite, bacon butties and all for free!!! Earlier this year (January to March 2023) we used the venue as a Hot Spot / Warm Hub, which was very well attended and received, and we are able to provide the same facility again only over a longer period (November 2023 until March 2024).","hours":{"_text":"Wednesday: 11:00 - 14:00, Saturday: 11:00 - 14:00","opening":"We 11:00-14:00; Sa 11:00-14:00"},"title":"Tilney All Saints Village Hall"},"type":"Feature"},
