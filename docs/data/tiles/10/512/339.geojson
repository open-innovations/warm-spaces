We provide a safe and friendly environment in which we can assist them in a number of ways including finding accommodation. The demand for housing in this area always outstrips availability so it can take time to find suitable accommodation and we are always looking for good landlords to work with us. The day centre provides a place to access housing advice and practical assistance to secure accommodation, social contact, training sessions, employment advice, health services, washing facilities, food, clothing, general guidance and support. Outreach Our outreach workers respond to reports of rough sleepers by going out on the streets and meeting with them. Inform them of services available, encourage them to come to the centre. Sometimes it takes time to build trust and confidence so this can take several visits until they are ready to come into the centre. We also carry out joint outreach with other agencies such as; DWP to ensure a rough sleeper is getting the benefits they are entitled to and not having to beg for money and food; drug and alcohol treatment teams and mental health teams to engage with rough sleepers and help them access services so they can get help to stay well and safe. We will ensure they have food, water, clothes and warm dry bedding until they are ready to access services. Day Centre Services The day centre provides a safe and friendly environment. We also have showers, clean clothes, refreshments, breakfast, healthy freshly cooked meal, assistance to claim benefits, seek accommodation, training and volunteering opportunities to enhance employability and confidence and life skills. We facilitate several workshop sessions to help with knowledge, confidence and well-being such as an art project, cooking skills, job club, computer club and the opportunity to complete accredited courses. Volunteering at the centre also enables our clients to help shape the services and provide insight to help us plan future projects. Help to seek and secure accommodation We have experienced staff to help find solutions to relieve or prevent homelessness, we have links with many local landlords in the private rented sector and can help remove barriers to securing accommodation through one of our deposit schemes. We also run a weekly tenancy workshop to help people who are struggling with their accommodation or who are seeking alternative accommodation. We hold regular multi-agency meetings with relevant partners to explore options, source suitable accommodation and develop support plans. Prevention of Homelessness The earliest someone is aware they are at risk of losing their accommodation and are at risk of becoming homeless the better, as prevention is far better than cure. We can liaise with the landlord and other agencies, provide mediation, work out repayments for arrears, provide support and assistance to ensure the tenant can stay in property. Warm Space Streets2Homes Day Room is open Monday to Friday 9am to 2pm for a warm welcome as well as teas and coffees for a 50p donation (no fee for homeless). You can find contact details on the Streets2Homes website.","title":"Streets2Homes","url":"https://www.essexmap.co.uk/places/streets2homes/"},"type":"Feature"},

These warm banks will be free to attend and offer a safe haven for people to seek warmth and relaxation when in need. Excelcare is a family run care provider with homes located across London, Essex, Cambridge and Milton Keynes. Providing person centred care since 1989, this award-winning provider has been at the forefront of the care sector for over 30 years. With the current cost of living crisis crippling families across the UK and the temperature steadily dropping as we approach winter, Excelcare has launched their warm bank initiative to provide support to an age group that are most likely to feel the harsh effects of the cold and rising energy costs. From 11am-4pm, people aged 65 and over will be welcomed into Excelcare homes listed in the graphic to seek refuge from the cold and enjoy a hot drink. The warm banks in each home are situated in communal areas such as lounges and dining rooms, so guests will also have the opportunity to engage with people who live and work in them. This will provide some welcomed company to elderly members of the community, especially those who live on their own or struggle with feelings of loneliness. Precautions are in place to ensure those who currently live and work in the homes remain safe and free from the spread of infection, so upon entry guests will be asked to sanitise their hands, complete a lateral flow test* and wear a face mask for the duration of their visit. Helen Bennett, Regional Operations Director of Excelcare homes in Essex said, “it’s a pleasure to announce the opening of our warm banks in care homes across the region. Providing a safe space for people who are in need this winter is something we have been committed to doing and I am so happy to see this initiative come to life. “I encourage people over the age of 65 to make use of these warm banks and seek refuge in our comfortable homes surrounded by our caring teams.” Warm banks in each of the homes participating will be opening today and closing on March 31st, 2023.","hours":{"_text":"Mo 11:00-16:00; Tu 11:00-16:00; We 11:00-16:00; Th 11:00-16:00; Fr 11:00-16:00","opening":"Mo 11:00-16:00; Tu 11:00-16:00; We 11:00-16:00; Th 11:00-16:00; Fr 11:00-16:00"},"title":"Excelcare","url":"https://www.essexmap.co.uk/places/excelcare/"},"type":"Feature"},
