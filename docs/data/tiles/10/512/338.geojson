Groups can range from about thirty to eighty members in each choir, with members spanning all ages. Come for the great music, make new friends, you can perform with us, and it’s great for mental health and well-being too. We are always working towards new exciting projects, which might be a recording, a flash mob, a local community event or a large-scale production – in which all our groups combine for an epic concert. There’s never any obligation to perform but read some of our members’ testimonials and check out some of the videos on our media page, as once you’ve taken the plunge and sung with a few hundred people, you certainly get the bug and will most likely want to do it again and again.","hours":{"_text":"We 19:30-21:00","opening":"We 19:30-21:00"},"title":"Somewhere to Sing","url":"https://www.essexmap.co.uk/places/somewhere-to-sing/"},"type":"Feature"},
