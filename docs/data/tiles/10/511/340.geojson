We run a wide range of activities that cater to the diverse needs of our community. Our weekly Kids' Club offers a safe, nurturing environment where young people can engage in creative learning and build friendships. We operate a twice-weekly food bank and a weekly food hub, providing essential support to families facing hardship. For older residents, we host regular social activities designed to combat loneliness and encourage community participation. In addition, we facilitate a weekly men's wellness group at Clapham Cube, combining boxing and mental health discussions to promote emotional resilience and personal growth. Draper Together is a registered charity, governed by a Board of Trustees who bring expertise in community development, education, health, and the arts. Our day-to-day operations are overseen by a small, dedicated team of staff and volunteers, led by myself as Director. We are deeply embedded in the community we serve, and our approach is always collaborative and responsive to local needs. Decision-making at Draper Together is democratic and community-driven. Major strategic decisions are made by the Board of Trustees, informed by regular consultation with staff, volunteers, service users, and local partners. We actively seek feedback through surveys, community meetings, and informal conversations, ensuring our services remain relevant and impactful. Our management style is hands-on, flexible, and rooted in a genuine commitment to empowering the community. Ultimately, Draper Together exists to create a welcoming, supportive space where people of all ages and backgrounds can thrive.

At RJ4All, we believe that in order to achieve community cohesion and reduce anti-social behaviour, first we must adopt a holistic approach that addresses the reasons that lead to divisions. Poverty and power abuse must be rooted out, if we are genuinely interested in supporting and empowering communities to participate and indeed enjoy civic life equally. To this end, all local service providers (public, private and voluntary) must come together and under the guidance of the restorative justice values of power sharing, equality, dignity and respect support local communities.
