Poverty and power abuse must be rooted out, if we are genuinely interested in supporting and empowering communities to participate and indeed enjoy civic life equally. To this end, all local service providers (public, private and voluntary) must come together and under the guidance of the restorative justice values of power sharing, equality, dignity and respect support local communities.
