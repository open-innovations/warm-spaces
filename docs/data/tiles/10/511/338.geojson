It is a free, public area where you can meet others, catch up on work, or simply take a break. It’s open to everyone – whether you’re visiting the Gallery or just looking for a quiet, welcoming space. There are plenty of activities available for children too, making it a space for all ages. Bring your own packed lunch, connect to our free Wi-Fi, or help yourself to a hot drink or squash.

Beautifully designed, welcoming and interactive, the museum’s photographs, iconic objects and rotating décor, take audiences on a memorable journey through the commercial, educational, and domestic history of Letchworth Garden City. Learn how Letchworth’s founder, Ebenezer Howard, combined the best of both town and country to make the Garden City a great place to live and work. Admire the 60s retro sideboard and telephone table, and immerse yourself in the style of a mid-century home furnished by Meredew of Letchworth, one of the most important contemporary furniture manufacturers in the UK. Other design success stories that you can admire include the Chater-Lea bicycles and the Everyman’s Library, created by publisher J. M. Dent who built Temple Press in Letchworth to print the one shilling, which are now collectable classics. Offering something for everyone, young children can play at a full-size shop with counter and original working till. A smaller market stall entertains the younger shoppers with aromatic carbolic soap and pear drops evoking days gone by. Grab a pen and leave your mark on the museum’s whiteboard wall! Exhibits are updated regularly with historical objects from the Garden City Collection: an archive of over 250,000 objects looked after by the Heritage Foundation. The museum is located at One Garden City, off Broadway Gardens, and open every Monday to Saturday from 10am to 4pm.","hours":{"_text":"Monday: 10:00 - 16:00, Tuesday: 10:00 - 16:00, Wednesday: 10:00 - 16:00, Thursday: 10:00 - 16:00, Friday: 10:00 - 16:00, Saturday: 10:00 - 16:00","opening":"Mo 10:00-16:00; Tu 10:00-16:00; We 10:00-16:00; Th 10:00-16:00; Fr 10:00-16:00; Sa 10:00-16:00"},"title":"Museum at One Garden City"},"type":"Feature"},
