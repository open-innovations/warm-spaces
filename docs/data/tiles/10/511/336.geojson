This is why we have funded a number of Warm hubs that can support people during the cost-of-living crisis. Warm hubs provide a safe place which is warm, friendly and welcoming where attendees can partake in social activities surrounded by the company of others whilst receiving support during difficult times. They offer a lifeline for people in social isolation and those suffering with fuel poverty. The cafe is also open but there is no requirement to buy. Come in, stay warm and have a natter!
