The retailer first launched Winter Warmers in November 2022 for two months in a bid to support older customers who were disproportionately affected by the spiralling living costs, with 65-to-74-year-olds experiencing a Â£163 year-on-year drop in disposable income in August 2022. The initiative saw over 650,000 Â£1 soup meals served in its stores across the UK. ; The offer is available all day, every day and will run alongside the 'Kids eat for Â£1' offer which continues to be hugely popular, with more than 2.6 million meals served throughout Asda cafÃ©s since its launch in June 2022, and over 180,000 in the last four weeks alone. ; Earlier this year Asda refreshed its Kids Eat for Â£1 menu adding a more nutritionally balanced offer, including new vegan and healthy meal options. As an alternative to a hot meal, Boston's Asda cafÃ© also offer a Â£1 kids cold pick and mix selection that includes a sandwich, drink and piece of fruit. The refreshed menu now includes new treats such as a jelly pot with whole fruit pieces or a jelly squeeze pouch as an alternative to a pack of crisps. The offer is available to children aged under 16 years, and no other purchase is necessary. ; The latest figures from Asda's income tracker reveal that 40% of the lowest earning households are still experiencing negative disposable income in September, meaning that their income does not cover what they need to spend on bills and other essentials. ; Stephen Bromby, Asda Boston's community champion said: &quot;We know winter is set to be incredibly hard for thousands of pensioners as they continue to worry about how to keep themselves warm in the face of rising living costs and on a fixed income. ; &quot;Last year, at Asda we served over 650,000 meals to the over 60's in two months, by bringing the initiative back for 2023 we hope it will prove just as impactful across the winter months for those who need it most.&quot; ; In addition to the Winter Warmers, the Kids Eat for Â£1 meal deal continues to be popular with families, now serving over 2.6 million meals since its launch back in June 2022. ; The Boston supermarket will also run a 'Community Cuppa' campaign in its cafÃ© by creating space for community groups who may otherwise struggle to meet due to rental costs or high energy costs. Spaces will be available on weekdays in November and December from 2pm to 6pm and all community group members who visit will receive unlimited free tea or coffee. Spaces must be booked in advance by contacting Stephen Bromby on community_boston@asda.co.uk ; These initiatives will run throughout the festive season alongside Asda's 'emergency responder' offer of a free hot drink for emergency responders to thank them for their service. The customer still needs to go to the till in the cafÃ© to show their ID or be in uniform. Emergency responders are classed as fire brigade, police, ambulance, NHS, coastguard, prison officers and the UK military (Army, Navy, Air Force) ;","loc_pcd":true,"title":"Asda","url":"https://www.boston.gov.uk/article/22194/Asda"},"type":"Feature"},
