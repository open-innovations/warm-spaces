Our 1.5-acre site, hidden away in the middle of a housing estate, has been transformed from an overgrown wasteland to a thriving community space which now includes a vegetable garden, kid’s forest play area, orchard, wildlife pond, medicinal garden and a wooden roundhouse. The garden is run by a core group of 10-15 volunteers who give their time each week to make sure it is open for anyone to join, whether volunteer or just to visit. We are open all year round for at least 3 days per week. Members of the core group divide the responsibilities for leading different projects onsite, running activities/events with overarching responsibilities including communications and volunteer coordination. We are a constituted community group with a Board comprising a Chair, Secretary and Treasurer.
