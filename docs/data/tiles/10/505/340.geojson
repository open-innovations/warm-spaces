All are welcome. We serve hot drinks and cake, and soup and a roll during the colder months. There are puzzles and games for any children who visit and you are welcome to borrow a book from our little library shelves. We regularly have folk sharing skills, for example, during the last few months we have painted rocks, made Christmas decorations, and learned how to make some stunning mosaics. We've also had a local choir visit and have other exciting things planned.","hours":{"_text":"Wednesday: 13:00 - 1500","opening":"We 13:00-15:00"},"title":"Candle Community Cafe"},"type":"Feature"},
