This started as a Warm Space in Autumn of 2022 but we decided to keep it going weekly as people liked coming. Free tea and coffee. Material, wool, fabric, knitting needles, sewing machine are available or bring your own craft projects. We sometimes do workshops like lampshade making or felting but it is all very informal. Natterers are always welcome so no obligation to knit or sew! Our Community Fridge is open at the same time in the office next door mostly offering fruit, veg and bread so people are welcome to bring what they can and take what they need.","hours":{"_text":"Wednesday: 10:00 - 12:00","opening":"We 10:00-12:00"},"title":"Knit and Natter"},"type":"Feature"},
