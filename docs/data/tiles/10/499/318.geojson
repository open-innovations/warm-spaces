Please come and join us in the Garden Room – drop in anytime throughout the afternoon between 2pm and 4pm and feel free to bring someone else too. Our volunteers will be on hand to provide tea and cake and there are board games or cards for those that want to play. You can just drop in for a cuppa, or come and play a game of cards or dominoes, read the Sunday papers, meet up with village friends, or just have a chat. See you on a Sunday afternoon!","hours":{"_text":"Sunday: 14:00 - 16:00","opening":"Su 14:00-16:00"},"title":"Garden Room @ Killearn Village Hall"},"type":"Feature"}
