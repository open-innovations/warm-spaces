We have comfortable seats, tea and coffees available, WiFi and public access PCs as well as a branch of Carmarthenshire Library which is accessed through a self-service terminal (and our librarians attend on a Wednesday 12-4pm). We will also be holding volunteer led sessions on 'Make do and Mend' on a Monday, 'Gardening with what you have' on a Wednesday and 'Making your Food go Further' sessions on a Friday focussing on cooking skills, food preservation and storage. Free homemade soup (always vegetable so its accessible to as many people as possible) will be available daily from 11am. We have support workers from agencies (Pobl, The Wallich, Mencap, NHS outreach, Social Prescribers and Council Services) who provide drop in services throughout the month. Our space is accessible, warm and our staff and volunteers are friendly approachable and non-judgemental. Pop in for a cuppa, we'd love to meet you!","hours":{"_text":"Monday: 10:00 - 13:00, Wednesday: 10:00 - 13:00, Friday: 10:00 - 13:00","opening":"Mo 10:00-13:00; We 10:00-13:00; Fr 10:00-13:00"},"title":"Lles Cynnes - Warm Space"},"type":"Feature"}
