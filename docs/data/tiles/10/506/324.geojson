It’s colourful, cosy, and inclusive — with fairy lights, chill-out corners, music in the background, and shelves full of art supplies, journals, and sensory materials. It’s not a youth club — it’s a space for expression, belonging, and creative freedom. One corner might host quiet sketching or poetry writing, while another becomes a pop-up makeup tutorial or collaborative art piece. Whether someone comes to connect or just be, it’s a safe, accepting environment where difference is celebrated and imagination leads the way. It’s The GloHouse come to life — glowing, grounded, and built with purpose.","hours":{"_text":"Monday: 09:00 - 18:00, Tuesday: 09:00 - 18:00, Wednesday: 09:00 - 18:00, Thursday: 09:00 - 18:00, Friday: 09:00 - 16:30","opening":"Mo 09:00-18:00; Tu 09:00-18:00; We 09:00-18:00; Th 09:00-18:00; Fr 09:00-16:30"},"title":"The GloHouse @ ArtTee Studio"},"type":"Feature"},
