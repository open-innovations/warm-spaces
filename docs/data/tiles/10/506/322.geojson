This is open to anyone, and is a warm and welcoming atmosphere. We regularly have about 30 people attending. Conversation flows, any problems can be discussed. Everyone supports each other. We have a wonderful Warm Space team of 5 volunteers who help on the day. We provide homemade cheese scones, biscuits, teas and coffees. Everything is free, but people do tend to put a £1 donation in a pot, which goes towards running our village hall.","hours":{"_text":"Wednesday: 10:00 - 12:00","opening":"We 10:00-12:00"},"title":"Longhorsley Warm Space"},"type":"Feature"}
