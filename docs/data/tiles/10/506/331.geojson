The community centre is based in Hyde (Tameside) in the Werneth Ward, which is located next to the Godley ward (according to 2001 Census is one of the most deprived wards of the country). Both these wards house most of the 10000 Bangladeshi community of Tameside. Early indication from the latest census shows the demographic and status is much the same, with increase in population and higher unemployment issues. HBWAs objectives are: To represent the needs of local Hyde community in accessing local services. To promote capacity building and community cohesion by organising social and cultural events which Create a better understanding between the diverse communities. To provide additional support to Bangladeshi people in Hyde with cultural and language Barriers in accessing services. To provide advice and guidance on issues for the community in welfare, housing, health, Education, employment and immigration and other areas. To provide training opportunities for local people to improve the employment and education levels and improve the quality of life. HBWA was set up originally by people originating from Bangladesh. Bearing this in mind, our organisation celebrates memorable days of Bangladesh which include: Independence Day, Victory Day, Mother Tongue Day and religious Eid celebrations annually, along with other annual celebrations like International Women’s Week and volunteers Week. We also deliver regular training, courses and workshops in the year to enhance the knowledge skills and experiences of local people, which helps their personal development. We work in partnership with other agencies in the area and the local authority to offer the best services to the community with lots of choices, options and awareness of what is available to them. The projects and services we run here are on a needs basis for the community after regular consultation and feedback for what the local people want.","hours":{"_text":"Monday: 09:00 - 17:00, Tuesday: 09:00 - 18:00, Wednesday: 09:00 - 17:00, Thursday: 09:00 - 17:00, Friday: 09:00 - 17:00","opening":"Mo 09:00-17:00; Tu 09:00-18:00; We 09:00-17:00; Th 09:00-17:00; Fr 09:00-17:00"},"title":"HBWA Warm Hub"},"type":"Feature"},
