Our purpose-built centre comprises: a community cafe providing wholesome, affordable food whilst also acting as a social hub; an IT learning suite; two community rooms; a large training kitchen; and an outside produce-growing area. We provide: vital signposting and support for people needing help and advice; we help to avert social isolation; there are free courses in Maths, English and IT; free weekly drop-in sessions for people wanting to brush up their skills and/or get help with their CV and/or are thinking about returning to work after a break; volunteering and work experience opportunities; social activities such as bingo; cookery sessions for children and vulnerable families; and a new money management advice and form-filling service to support people in these tough economic times. We run a community larder twice a week for local residents. Members pay £5 per weekly visit for two carrier bags of fresh, frozen, refrigerated, tinned and dried food and other household essentials which they choose for themselves. If they pick wisely, they'll receive £20 to £30 of goods and no one needs a referral.","hours":{"_text":"Tuesday: 09:00 - 16:00, Wednesday: 09:00 - 16:00, Thursday: 09:00 - 16:00, Friday: 09:00 - 16:00","opening":"Tu 09:00-16:00; We 09:00-16:00; Th 09:00-16:00; Fr 09:00-16:00"},"title":"Downside Community Centre"},"type":"Feature"},
