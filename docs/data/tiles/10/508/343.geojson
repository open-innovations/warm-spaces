But as people age, they often find themselves spending more time alone. Being alone may leave older adults more vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation, which can affect their health and well-being. Studies show that loneliness and social isolation are associated with higher risks for health problems such as heart disease, depression, and cognitive decline. If you are in poor health, you may be more likely to be socially isolated or lonely. If you are socially isolated or feeling lonely, it can put your physical and mental health at risk. Adults who are lonely or socially isolated are less healthy, have longer hospital stays, are readmitted to the hospital more often, and are more likely to die earlier than those with meaningful and supportive social connections.","hours":{"_text":"Monday: 10:00 - 15:00, Tuesday: 10:00 - 15:00, Wednesday: 10:00 - 15:00, Thursday: 10:00 - 15:00, Friday: 10:00 - 15:00, Saturday: 11:00 - 14:00","opening":"Mo 10:00-15:00; Tu 10:00-15:00; We 10:00-15:00; Th 10:00-15:00; Fr 10:00-15:00; Sa 11:00-14:00"},"title":"C2U Gosport"},"type":"Feature"},
