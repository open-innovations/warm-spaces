A suggested donation of £2.00 for 10 items and this enables the community to choose from the weekly offering. A library space has been created within the church, which offers individuals to buy or borrow books, magazines, periodicals, etc for a small donation. The church also holds a regular Tea Room in the church, which provides, hot drinks, soups, hot and cold food, cakes, etc. along with local villagers offering fresh vegetables, eggs, and preserves at a preferential cost. In addition, we have a small gift stall where small items can be bought at a reduced priced along with a flower and plant stall. We are hoping to expand both of these two events in the church, however due to its size and going into the Winter Months, it is an extensive building to heat in its entirety, therefore we are looking for funding to segregate an area to provide a warmer space, along with facility to make crafts and engage in activities.
