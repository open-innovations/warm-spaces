We offer a welcoming space for people to meet and have hot drinks and something light to eat. We also provide papers, magazines and puzzles. We provide tea, coffee and cake ‘on a pay as you feel’ donation basis (with free tea and coffee refills). Some people like to pop in for buttered crumpets or teacakes; our ‘bacon butties’ mornings are always popular. We often have themed days, e.g., Pancake Day, where we served fresh pancakes, and also had fun events (including pancake races for children). We also have craft activities (e.g., mosaic making sets), that visitors can come and sit and do, as we have found these mindful activities help people relax, and provide a focus for people who are struggling with anxiety and mental issues. Tables are also set up in the small side room (off the main hall) to provide a ‘quiet space’ for those who find social settings difficult, and this also serves as a ‘shared working from home’ space. Free Wi-Fi is provided. We have incorporated a Parent & Toddler group into the Community Hub, which has been well used and goes from strength to strength. During the holidays we have encouraged the attendance of older siblings and provided craft activities for them to do. We are keen to promote sustainability in the community whenever we can – the GRowsley community group and local allotment holders donate excess produce. Visitors are encouraged to help themselves to these local vegetables, fruit and jam or chutney, or to exchange items e.g., blackberries and apples when in season.","hours":{"_text":"Tuesday: 09:00 - 13:00","opening":"Tu 09:00-13:00"},"title":"Community Hub"},"type":"Feature"},
