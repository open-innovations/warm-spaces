We offer a friendly, safe, heated space with a free light lunch, cake and hot drinks. We have found that most people enjoy coming for the company and the chat, though puzzle building, knitting and card games are also very popular pursuits. Our volunteers make the refreshments, serve lunch and, most importantly, are a friendly face and love to chat. We are also blessed with donations of wonderful cakes! We are planning more activities in the coming months such as speakers, seated exercise and a film afternoon. The success of Warm Welcome Space in Ducklington is truly down to all our wonderful volunteers, the generous financial donations and the friendly people who come along each Thursday. Please join us if you can either by visiting or becoming a volunteer. All ages are welcome.","hours":{"_text":"Thursday: 11:30 - 15:00","opening":"Th 11:30-15:00"},"title":"Ducklington Warm Welcome Space"},"type":"Feature"},
