For much of that time, our iconic Lantern Tower has served as a sign to our communities that they were approaching safety and belonging as they returned home to this city and region. Inspired by Jesus Christ, the Light of the World, the Cathedral today continues to serve its communities through its deep commitment to being a place of radical welcome, offering inspiring worship, and striving to empower worth within all who come into contact with us. Whilst we are based in the City of Newcastle, we are also the ‘Mother Church’ of the Diocese of Newcastle, and seat of the Bishop of Newcastle. Newcastle is the Church of England’s most northerly diocese, covering the whole of Northumberland as well as areas covered by Newcastle City and North Tyneside Councils. Our role is to be a focus of unity and a resource for the Church of England’s 240 local churches and 49 schools, which are also striving to be beacons of light where they are located.","hours":{"_text":"Monday: 08:00 - 18:00, Tuesday: 08:00 - 18:00, Wednesday: 08:00 - 18:00, Thursday: 08:00 - 18:00, Friday: 08:00 - 18:00, Saturday: 08:00 - 17:00, Sunday: 08:00 - 17:00","opening":"Mo 08:00-18:00; Tu 08:00-18:00; We 08:00-18:00; Th 08:00-18:00; Fr 08:00-18:00; Sa 08:00-17:00; Su 08:00-17:00"},"title":"Newcastle Cathedral"},"type":"Feature"},
