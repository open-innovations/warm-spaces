Lambourn is a rural community built up around the racehorse training industry with limited public transport to the nearest town which is 9 miles away. The Lambourn Lunch Club provides a safe, warm place to meet and have a free meal for those who are impacted by the cost of living and rural isolation. We carefully analysed the benefits to the community before starting the Lambourn lunch club and the feedback to date has been very positive indeed. If you would like to join us for a meal and a chat next week, please give Helen a call 07770 394 123 to book a place. No pressure, no judgement just good company and a delicious hot meal followed by tea and coffee.","hours":{"_text":"Thursday: 12:00 - 14:00","opening":"Th 12:00-14:00"},"title":"Lambourn Lunch Club"},"type":"Feature"},
