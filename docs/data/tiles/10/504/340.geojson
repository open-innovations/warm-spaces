The group provides a social opportunity where people can get to know others in the area whilst engaging in positive creative activities, learn new skills and reduce isolation. The group is accessible to people of all levels whether beginners or more advanced - it is a space where skills can be developed with and from others so everyone can learn together. Creative Space is a welcoming space where local people are supported to grow and develop in making art, to engage in developing joint projects and to share and develop creative skills and to showcase their work through local community events and activities. Free hot drinks & crafts - all abilities welcome!","loc_pcd":true,"title":"Creative Space Redcliffe - Bristol","url":"https://www.placesforpeople.co.uk/about-us/community/community-projects/creative-space-redcliffe-bristol/"},"type":"Feature"}
