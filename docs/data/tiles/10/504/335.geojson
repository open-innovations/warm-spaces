We want everyone in our neighbourhood to have a place to go for a friendly face, a cup of tea and a conversation if and when they need it. We share stories, advice, our talents and information - and lots of biscuits and cake! We are open every Saturday in the church (postcode: TF8 7DA) 11am - 1pm. We also hold our Buildwas Book Swap at the same time - bring a book and swap for another - and chat about what you've read with other visitors to our Place of Welcome. Our Place of Welcome is part of the wider network of Places of Welcome co-ordinated by the Church Urban Fund (CUF), Near Neighbours and the Together Network. During the winter (November - April), our Place of Welcome moves to Buildwas Village Hall (on Park View - postcode TF8 7BZ), a short walk from the church, as the church is currently too difficult to heat comfortably in the winter.","hours":{"_text":"Saturday: 11:00 - 13:00","opening":"Sa 11:00-13:00"},"title":"Buildwas Holy Trinity Church"},"type":"Feature"},
